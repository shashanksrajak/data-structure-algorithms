        "\n",
        "**You are tasked with designing an advanced queue management system for a hospital's emergency room. This system must handle patients arriving and being treated based on several criteria. Patients are prioritized based on the following rules:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Critical Level** (Integer from 1 to 5): Patients with a higher critical level are treated first (1 being the least critical and 5 being the most critical).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Arrival Time**: If two patients have the same critical level, the one who arrived first is treated first.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Special Cases**: Certain patients might be marked as a \"Special Case\" and must be treated immediately upon arrival, regardless of their critical level or arrival time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**You need to implement a queue system that supports the following operations:**\n",

        "Add Patient (addPatient):\n",

        "Inputs: patient_id (String), critical_level (Integer), arrival_time (String in \"HH\n",

        "\n",
        "Adds a new patient to the queue based on the above rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Treat Patient (treatPatient):\n",
        "\n",
        "Outputs: patient_id (String) of the patient being treated\n",
        "\n",
        "Removes and returns the patient who should be treated next based on the queue rules.\n",

        "Inputs: patient_id (String)\n",

        "\n",
        "You can assume the arrival_time is always in a 24-hour format and all patients have unique patient_id.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system should handle up to 100 patients/day efficiently.\n",
